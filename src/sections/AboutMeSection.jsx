      Hi, I am a recently completed my . 
      I have developed WebApps, APIs, Desktop Apps and Android Apps and 
      I want to improve on Web technologies such as .NET Core  or  Node.js and React..
      </p>

        Coming from a background from Commerce , I
        quickly found that writing code was a bit like putting the secret sauce
