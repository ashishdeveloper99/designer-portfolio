The newly re-engineered stefankudla.com is created with Next.js, Tailwind, and Cosmic.js, wielding the nimble powers of the Jamstack!\n\n## Purpose and Goal\n\nAs I am moving away from WordPress development and toward JavaScript development, I wanted to take on a project that would push my limits, and improve my online presence.\n\nI felt that while having a personal website built on WordPress got the job done, it just didn't represent who I was as a developer. Ultimately, I now have the freedom to show my true potential while continuously implementing awesome features to my website.\n\n## Tools used\n\n- Next.js\n- TypeScript\n- Tailwind\n- Cosmic.js\n- Node.js\n- Framer Motion\n\n## Spotlight\n\nMy favorite thing about this project isn't actually something that you can see on the UI or in the code, but  rather a lesson I learned from building it.\n\nI learned that confidence is required to be a developer and build projects. Sometimes it's all about jumping into something, knowing that you know *absolutely nothing* about what you're trying to do, but trusting that you have the persistence to find the solution.\n\nWhile I am proud of the minimal layout of the site and the way it makes API calls  to retrieve my blog posts and works, I am just happy to have been able to take the time to learn the ins and outs of programming and apply it to my website.\n\n## Challenges\n\nTypeScript was the first major challenge. Prior to building this site, I had little to no experience typing my JavaScript code. I tried my best to stay consistent and avoid code smells, though I now have a solid understanding of TypeScript, and how it optimized JavaScript.\n\n## Main Takeaways\n\nI think it's good to be proud of the projects you build. That is time *you* spent writing code that *you* made functional, and it feels good when everything is shipped and deployed. I genuinely look forward to writing production level code with an awesome team.\n\n"}},"morePosts":[{"slug":"getting-started-with-this-template","title":"Getting Started With This Template","created_at":"2022-06-09T01:29:20.477Z","metadata":{"category":{"id":"637d165ed3f5d90e12c3a84c","bucket":"637d16597baeb5000824f20e","slug":"cosmic","title":"Cosmic","content":"","metafields":[],"created":"2022-06-09T01:12:10.362Z","created_at":"2022-06-09T01:12:10.362Z","modified_at":"2022-11-22T18:35:09.135Z","status":"published","published_at":"2022-06-09T01:12:10.362Z","type":"post-categories"},"cover_image":{"url":"https://cdn.cosmicjs.com/bfe43b80-9a23-11ea-bf2a-2b6ff88d4f06-deploying.webp","imgix_url":"https://imgix.cosmicjs.com/bfe43b80-9a23-11ea-bf2a-2b6ff88d4f06-deploying.webp"},"excerpt":"Here are a few things to keep in mind when setting up this template.","content":"## Overview\n\nFirst and foremost, this template is a wonderful resource to get familiar with using [Cosmic](https://cosmicjs.com/). With the simple functionality of a blog, you will learn how Cosmic serves as a home for all of your content. Once you get going with your setup, I encourage you to write a blog post or two so that you can see Cosmic in action! Here is a [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to get you started.\n\nAfter familiarizing yourself with the flow of writing blog posts, you will see that your data streamlines through your code, being converted to JSON which you can access in no time. Within this template, markdown is serialized to HTML with [remark-html](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html). This allows us to take that markdown that we can conveniently write in the Cosmic dashboard and inject it anywhere we'd like in our code!\n\nFurthermore, once you become comfortable within the Cosmic dashboard, feel free to explore the many ways in which you can create value within your projects! With Cosmic, you are by no means limited to writing blog posts or content. Try different content approaches like writing your components in an object and creating things like menus, category lists, or even entire page layouts. All this information is just a query away.\n\n## Basic Setup Within Your Code\n\nThere are just a few things I would like to point up for those setting this up to use as their developer portfolio. \n\n1. Upload your resume to the public folder in the directory, and change the href to match your file name accordingly. In Visual Studio Code, you can search for all instances of \"your_resume_here\" and replace the pdf.\n\n2. Update the social links within the SocialIcons component. (src>components>SocialIcons.jsx)\n\n3. Changing the color palette is as easy as going into (src>styles>globals.css) and replacing the values under the .light and .dark classes. Mind that the .light and .dark classes represent light and dark modes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis template was built not only to help new users get their feet wet with Cosmic, but also with the end user in mind. We made sure to utilize best practices to ensure that performance and user experience were at top levels. We hope that you enjoy using Cosmic, and if there is anything you are confused about, don't hesitate to reach out [here](https://www.cosmicjs.com/contact) or feel free to join our [Slack](https://cosmicslack.herokuapp.com/) channel!"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
